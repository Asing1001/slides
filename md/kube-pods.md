## Pod

- A group of an applicationâ€™s container, storage resources, a unique network IP, and spec that govern how the container(s) should run.

Note:
- The basic execution unit of a Kubernetes
- An environment the containers run in and persists until it is deleted. 
- Could use different container runtime other than Docker(default)

## Network

- Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address.
- Containers inside a Pod can communicate with one another using localhost
- Containers in a Pod can not use same ports

---

## Storage

- A Pod can specify a set of shared storage Volumes, container inside pod can access shared volume

---

## Lifecycle
